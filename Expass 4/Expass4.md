## Technical issues
Initially I had some issues using postman for Experiment 1, however this was quickly resolved by installing the desktop agent. I had no other issues during this assignment.

## Pending issues
Not really a pending issue but due to time constraints and other compulsory assignments in other courses I did not have time to do the optional parts of expass 4, that is experiment 3 and 4. I will likely revisit this assignment at a later time but those tasks remain untouched for now.
